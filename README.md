# Markov-chain-for-text-generation
Aim:- Our motivation behind this project is to make a probabilistic model that can predict the text based on previous state of outputs.

Data Prepration Part:-

  Training Data:-
    It's just a usual corpus of data.
  Test Data:-
    Data train on runtime only, so no test data.

Model Planning:-
  We'll use markov model, the best part about the markov model is that
